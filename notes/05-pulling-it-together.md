Your assingment is simple: write a function that shows the colors in the queue AND on display in your staticly served page. This will be a mix of front-end and Node code.


Some challenges:

Can you set up your server to route BACK to the index when a user submits a color?
Can you add validation to your POST /addColor using Joi?
Can you write a /random route that sends a random color to the robot?
What else can you think of?
